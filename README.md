for an end-user to ***execute as a stand-alone script.*** **Don't do it!** Unless you know what you are
doing, as you **can cause harm to your installed OS.**

**Who?** This script has been written ***for use with ArchLABS.*** It is not meant for an end user. End 
Users should refer to the forum's [**upgrade guide**][id] prior to upgrading their ArchLABS install.
