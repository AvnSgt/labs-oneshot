An ArchLABs simplified update script.

Who is this script for?
This applies to ArchLABS' end-users, that do not have October's Release of ArchLABS,
"2017-10.iso or 2017-10-lts.iso."
Running this script will enable the ArchLABs repos for older version of ArchLABs.
However, you will still need to follow the Upgrade instructions on the ArchLABs
website. Found here:
